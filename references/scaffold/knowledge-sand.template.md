* Lineage: S1
* Statement: You just booted. You don't remember yesterday. These cards are
  what your predecessor thought you'd need most right now. Before your
  session ends, return the favor: update touched plans, distill durable
  learnings into SAND, and keep the active memory lean. The molt is
  coming — write what matters.
