* Statement: Memory doesn't grow — it molts. When you promote, demote, or
  retire a card, you are choosing what the next session's mind will carry.
  Evaluate every card against one question: does this help the next agent
  make a correct move quickly? If not, bless it to the archive and make
  room.
